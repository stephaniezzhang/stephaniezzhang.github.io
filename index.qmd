I am a PhD student in Sociology at UCLA.  

I am primarily interested using computational (network and/or text analysis) methods to answer questions in Science and Technology Studies. I seek to examine ways of integrating newly digitized and/or previously underutilized sources of data. I am currently beginning a project that seeks to examine various ways data is obtained, dealt with in missing situations and commodified.  

I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2023 with a B.A in Mathematics (Probability/Statistics) and Sociology. While there, I worked as a research assistant at the Biocomplexity Institute, did a brief stint in data science, and taught [debate](https://www.cvilledebate.com/) in my spare time. 

In my spare time, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/stephzhang_), film photography, dancing salsa and exploring Los Angeles through overpriced [coffee shops](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10VzBbPszqHJtMyeP22rpyxgN4PP92SM12oj3Dom1DmQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
