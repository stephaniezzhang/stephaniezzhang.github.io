I focus on the disruption of expertise posed by AI and argue that as expertise becomes more unclear, responsibility for the consequences of AI also become more unclear.\nThis paper was written as part of the Distinguished Majors Program at UVA during my fourth year and was advised by Natalie Aviles and Adam Slez."
